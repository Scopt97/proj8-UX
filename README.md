# Project 8: User interface for uthenticated brevet time calculator service

The goal of this project is to create frontend/UI for Brevet app using Flask-WTF
and Flask-Login introduced in lectures 08a-flask-login and 08b-flask-wtf. You frontend/UI will reuse the
authentication service that you created in project 7 (https://github.com/UOCIS322/proj7-auth); in this project,  you are only adding
a facelift to the services. In addition to creating UI for basic authentication and token
generation, you will add three additional functionalities in your UI: (a) remember me, (b) logout, 
and (c) CSRF protection. Note: You donâ€™t have to maintain sessions.


#### Notes:
credentials.ini goes in the app/ folder
The resources still use token authentication (and expect the token in a "token" header)
